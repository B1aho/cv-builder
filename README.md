## What I learned
- Thinking in React: 
Understanding how to break the UI into reusable components and structure them hierarchically.
- Component-based architecture: 
Creating modular and independent components to manage different parts of the application.
- Unidirectional data flow: 
Observing how React ensures predictable state management by using a one-way data binding approach.
- State and props: 
Differentiating between local component state and data passed from parent components through props.
